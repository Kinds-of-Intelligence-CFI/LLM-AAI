This folder contains files and folders relating to the 'tutorial video arena' (in reference to the tutorial that
children were given to learn how to use Animal-AI) whose human run will be used as n-shot examples for the LLMs
that will be tested in Animal-AI.

Note: the tutorial_video_arena_n_shot_commands.* files were used to generate the run and ARE NOT the n-shot examples
themselves. The n-shot examples can be found at the following location:
